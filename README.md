<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In osTicket, the password reset process follows a structured ticket lifecycle. Here's what happened based on that lifecycle:  

1. **Ticket Creation:** When the customer submitted a password reset request, a new ticket was generated in the system. This ticket was assigned a unique ID and categorized as an **Account/Login Issue** for tracking.  

2. **Ticket Assignment & Triage:** The support team reviewed the request, confirmed that the customer’s account was locked due to multiple failed login attempts, and classified it as a **password reset request**.  

3. **Resolution & Action Taken:** The support team reset the customer’s password and provided a temporary one, ensuring access could be regained. This step involved verifying account details and following security protocols.  

4. **Customer Notification:** The customer received a response with a new temporary password and instructions on how to log in and create a new, secure password.  

5. **Ticket Closure or Follow-Up:** If the customer successfully logged in and changed the password, the ticket would be marked as **resolved** and closed. However, if any issues persisted, the customer could reply to the ticket for further assistance, keeping it **open** until the issue was fully resolved.  

This structured process ensures efficiency, security, and a clear resolution path for login-related issues in osTicket.
